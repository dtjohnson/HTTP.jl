"""
The `HTTP.Handlers` module provides a middleware framework in conjuction with the `HTTP.Servers` server module.

The core interface function is:
```julia
handle(handler::Handler, request) => HTTP.Response
```

An http server is started by calling `HTTP.listen(handler::Union{Function, Handler}, ...)` and when a http request
is received, it is "handled" by the handler by calling `HTTP.handle(handler, request)`.

The `Handlers` framework is built to be extensible. It's very easy to chain handlers together to form a 
"middleware stack" of handler layers, or even define a custom handler type that could be re-used by others.

See `?HTTP.Servers` for an extended example of a server + custom handler framework usage

Abstract type representing an object that knows how to "handle" an http request and return an appropriate
http response.

Types of builtin handlers provided by the HTTP package include:
  * `HTTP.RequestHandlerFunction`: a julia function of the form `f(request::HTTP.Request)`
  * `HTTP.Router`: pattern matches request url paths to be handled by registered `Handler`s
  * `HTTP.StreamHandlerFunction`: a julia function of the form `f(stream::HTTP.Stream)`
